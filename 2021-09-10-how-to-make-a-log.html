<h1> Implementation of HTML elements</h1>
    <p> Paragraphs <p> 
  <p> In our implementation of the code, paragraphs in HTML are set using a tag </p>
  <p> The text contents for the paragraph are placed between the tags. Paragraphs elements are used to format many of the texts that are longer than one sentence. <p>
<p> This is a paragraph implementation to show how 
	a text behaves in an html web pages.
	It is placed between the p tags and can be formatted the way we want </p>

<p>  Bullet points <p>
  <p> This is implemented as an unordered list in the HTML web pages. The list of items in the element is bulleted. <p>
  <p> The primary tag for the bulleted list is "ol", and the individual items are implemented using the "li" tag. <p>
<p> This has been coded as shown below: <p>

<ul>
	<li> Bullet List Item 1</li>
	<li> Bullet List Item 2</li>
	<li> Bullet List Item 3</li>
	<li> Bullet List Item 4</li>
</ul>

 <p> 4. Numbered bullet points <p>
 <p>  The numbered bullet points are coded in HTML in the same way as the bulleted list above except for the "ul" tag, which tells the web page to number the list. <p>
 <p> The ordered list displays items in the list in numerical order. Additionally, the numbered list can be customized to be alphabetical or roman numerical using ‘’type.’’ 
 The code snippet is as shown below: <p>
  <ol>
	<li> Bullet List Item 1</li>
	<li> Bullet List Item 2</li>
	<li> Bullet List Item 3</li>
	<li> Bullet List Item 4</li>
</ol>

  <p> 5. Data table <p>
 <p> The html web page implementation of a table is by using "table" tag. It shows data in a tabular manner of rows and columns. <p> 
 <p> The table tags is used with element tags of "th", "tr", "td".  "tr" is used to represent a table row while the "th" tag is a table header and the td table data. Table headers th is placed between the table rows tr. 
 
  <table> 
	<tr><th>SN</th><th>Name</th><th>School</th></tr>  
	<tr><td>1</td><td>James A </td><td>633, ATL</td></tr>  
	<tr><td>2</td><td>N.Smith </td><td>300, MN</td></tr>  
	<tr><td>3</td><td>Adam Smith </td><td>40, TR</td></tr>  
	<tr><td>4</td><td>Reece Adams </td><td>520, ATL</td></tr>  
</table>

 <p> 6. Table of contents <p>
  <p> There is no HTML element that can out rightly be used to code a table of contents as required.<p>
<p>  Therefore, for us to implement the requirement, we use a combination of HTML tags and elements to achieve the desired content on a web page.<p>
<p>  The first element needed is an unordered list to accommodate the items of the table; using this, we can specify our numbering without relying on the auto-generated ones by the HTML
  The other important element needed is the link tag <a> and href to reference the contents pointed in the table of content.  <p>
	<ul> 
	  <li><a href="#paragraph-id">1 Pointer Header For Paragraph</a> 
	  <ul> 
		<li><a href="#unordered-list">1.1 Unoredered List</a></li> 
		<li><a href="#ordered-list">1.2 Ordered List</a></li> 
	  </ul> 
	</li> 
	<li><a href="#table-data">2 Data Table</a></li> 
	</ul>

Challenges and lessons learned
 Hypertext markup language has an easy and less challenging learning curve as compared to other web programming tools. 
  Equipped with an integrated development environment or even a basic notepad application, we can achieve most of the tasks.
  The HTML code that has been written runs on the web browser, and one can view the output of the code and make the necessary changes without many challenges.
  The basic tags and element implement of structure such as paragraphs, lists are much easy to achieve as compared to the coding of tables and tables of content took most of my time. 
  The total of my work for this report HTML approximately 8 hours, but to figure out the coding of tables and tables of contents took me more than half of that time.

  <pre>
  

Start time: I started on Saturday at 6:00 pm until 2:00 in the morning on Sunday. I'm taking half an hour to break and finish the rest of it on Sunday 

Duration: First 3 hours learning HTML and define what is HTML, CSS and JAvascript related: Every website is build with these 3 languages. 

Description: I have no idea what is HTML look like and what does it mean? So now I know HTML is for web development 
I spend time for the first 3 hour looking for a development environment that allows me to developjava program, I choose Visual Studio Code. 
First 3 hours: work around with html files, get use to the new developmentjava program, and install some extension to make it easy while I'm doing it

For example: Install 

Pretties(Code formatter) with this extension, I can look at my code and look easy 
Live Server: with this I can launch website inside development webserver/ 
For the browser view and text my webpages is google chrome 

I spend 2 hours working on my Data table and Table of content
I learned for table contents is no HTML element that can out rightly be used to code a table of contents as required. 

I spend an hour and half to write a report in my word document, explaination, screen shot, cut picture, fix grammar, organize text and picture
